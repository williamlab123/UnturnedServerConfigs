To create or change a workshop you modify the bundles.

For example, you want that the cars in your server have more life, you can do that by 2 ways, modifying the bundles or go to config file and change by there
(i recomend this one.) In the config file you will determinate several stuff, like how many zombies will spawn, if my structures resistence, etc. Be patiente and 
watchfull while doing this.
